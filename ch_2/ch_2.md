### Managing dependencies

#### Cargo.toml

Cargo understand Semantic Versioning.

Cargo.toml:
- 0.8.5 is actually shorthand for ^0.8.5
- [caret](https://carols10cents.github.io/cargo/specifying-dependencies.html) freezes the left-most non-zero digit

```
^1.2.3 := >=1.2.3 <2.0.0
^1.2 := >=1.2.0 <2.0.0
^1 := >=1.0.0 <2.0.0
^0.2.3 := >=0.2.3 <0.3.0
^0.0.3 := >=0.0.3 <0.0.4
^0.0 := >=0.0.0 <0.1.0
^0 := >=0.0.0 <1.0.0
```

Different from package.json.

package.json:
- tilde ~ flexible patch version
- caret ^ flexible minor version

When we include external dependency, Cargo fetches the latest versions from registry.

**registry** - a copy of data from [Crates.io](https://crates.io/).

#### Cargo.lock

Creates it during the very first build: figures out all the versions, writes them down -> next time can skip the figuring out part.


Will not update dep versions automatically --> reproducible builds of an artifact.


#### Updating deps


* To update dependencies:
$ cargo update

#### Dependency docs

To run documentation provided by all of the deps:\
$ cargo doc --open


#### Ch2 Code explained

```
    match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"), 
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"), 
        Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
    }
```
cmp(): takes a reference to whatever to compare with, returns a variant of Ordering.

A match expression is made up of arms.
An **arm** consists of a pattern to match against, and the code that should be run if the value given to match fits that armâ€™s pattern.

Unless otherwise specified, Rust defaults to an i32 (a 32 bit integer type).

#### Formatter

* To run in the current project:
$ cargo fmt
